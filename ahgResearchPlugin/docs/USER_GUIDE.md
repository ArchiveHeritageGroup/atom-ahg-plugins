- Email address
- ID type (National ID, Passport, Driver's License, Student Card, Other)
- ID number

**Optional Fields:**
- Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Prof)
- Phone
- Affiliation type (Independent, Academic, Government, Corporate, NGO)
- Institution, Department, Position
- Student ID
- Research interests (free text)
- Current project description
- ORCID iD

**Process Flow:**
```
Registration → Pending Status → Admin Review → Approved/Rejected
                                                    ↓
                                              Access Request Created
                                              (Internal clearance level)
```

On registration, an access request is automatically created requesting "Internal" clearance level. The admin can approve or reject through the researcher management interface.

### Rejection with Audit Trail

When a researcher is rejected:
1. All data is copied to `research_researcher_audit` table
2. The main record is deleted from `research_researcher`
3. The user account is deactivated (`user.active = 0`)
4. The access request is set to "denied" with the rejection reason
5. The email/user can re-register in the future

### Profile Management

**URL:** `/research/profile`

Researchers can update their profile information at any time. Changes are audit-logged.

### Researcher Types

Admins can configure researcher types that control access limits:

| Type | Max Advance Booking | Hours/Day | Materials/Booking | Remote Access | Auto-Approve |
|------|--------------------:|----------:|-----------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| General Public | 7 days | 2 hrs | 5 | No | No |
| Registered Researcher | 14 days | 4 hrs | 10 | No | No |
| Academic Staff | 30 days | 8 hrs | 20 | Yes | Yes |
| Postgraduate Student | 21 days | 6 hrs | 15 | No | No |
| Heritage Professional | 30 days | 8 hrs | 25 | Yes | Yes |

### Verification System

Researchers may need to verify their identity:

**Verification Types:**
- ID document verification
- Institutional affiliation verification
- Student enrollment verification
- Professional qualification verification

**Process:** Upload verification documents → Admin reviews → Verified/Rejected

Verified researchers get enhanced access. Verifications can have expiry dates (e.g., student enrollment verification expires annually).

### Credential Renewal

**URL:** `/research/renewal`

When a researcher's access expires (based on their type's `expiry_months`), they can request renewal through this page.

3. Select **start time** and **end time** (limited by `max_booking_hours_per_day`)
4. Specify **purpose** of visit (optional)
5. Add **notes** (optional)
6. Submit — booking status becomes "Pending"

### Booking Lifecycle

```
Pending → Confirmed (by admin) → Checked In → Completed (Checked Out)
   ↓                                              ↓
Cancelled                                    Materials Returned
```

### Material Requests

When viewing a booking, you can add material requests:

1. Search for archival items by title, identifier, or reference number
2. Add items to the booking's material request list
3. Each item gets a status: Requested → Delivered → Returned
4. Material request notes can be added per item

**Material request limits** are enforced by your researcher type (e.g., 10 items for Registered Researchers, 25 for Heritage Professionals).

### Check-In / Check-Out

### Walk-In Visitors

**URL:** `/research/walk-in`

For unregistered visitors who walk into the reading room without a booking:
1. Staff records visitor details (name, ID, purpose)
2. Visitor is assigned a temporary seat
3. On departure, staff checks them out
4. Walk-in visitors can later be converted to registered researchers

### Seat Assignment

**URL:** `/research/seats`

Reading rooms can have mapped seats:
- **Seat Map** (`/research/seats/map`) — Visual layout of the room
- **Auto-Assign** — System selects the best available seat based on preferences

- A `frozen_at` timestamp is recorded
- A **Citation ID** is generated: `SNAP-{projectId}-{snapshotId}-{shortHash}`
- Rights snapshots are captured per item

### Hash Verification

Each snapshot has a SHA-256 HMAC hash computed from:
- Snapshot metadata (query_state_json, rights_state_json, metadata_json)
- Each item's metadata_version_json and rights_snapshot_json
- Stable sorting by object_id ASC, object_type ASC

**Verify integrity:** The system recomputes the hash and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the snapshot is verified as unmodified.

### Comparing Snapshots

**URL:** `/research/snapshot/compare`

Compare two snapshots side-by-side:
- Items added since snapshot A
- Items removed since snapshot A
- Items present in both

### Snapshot Citation

Use the citation ID (e.g., `SNAP-5-23-a1b2c3d4`) to reference a specific state of a collection in publications, ensuring reproducibility.

## 20. Entity Resolution

### Overview

**URL:** `/research/entity-resolution`

Entity resolution identifies and links duplicate or related entities across archival collections. For example, recognizing that "J. Smith" in Collection A and "John Smith" in Collection B are the same person.

### Proposing Matches

Click "Propose Match" to open the proposal form:

**Fields:**
- Entity A: Type (actor/information_object/repository) and ID
- Entity B: Type and ID
- Relationship type:
  - **sameAs** — Identical entities (default)
  - **relatedTo** — Associated entities
  - **partOf** — Hierarchical relationship
  - **memberOf** — Group membership
- Match method: Manual, Name Similarity, Identifier Match, Authority Record
- Confidence score (0-1)
- Notes
- Evidence (one per line): `source_type | source_id | note`

### Automatic Candidate Finding

**URL:** `/research/entity-resolution/candidates?entity_type=actor&entity_id=123`

The system can find potential matches automatically:
1. Enter an entity type and ID
2. The system searches for similar entities using name similarity
3. Results are ranked by similarity score (0-1)
4. Only candidates above 30% similarity are shown

For actors, similarity is computed using PHP's `similar_text()` function on the authorized form of name.

### Reviewing Proposals

The entity resolution table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Entity A | Name, type, and ID |
| Entity B | Name, type, and ID |
| Relationship | sameAs, relatedTo, partOf, memberOf |
| Confidence | Color-coded progress bar |
| Method | How the match was identified |
| Evidence | Count with expandable evidence table |
| Resolver | Who resolved the proposal |
| Status | Proposed, Accepted, Rejected |

### Conflict Detection

Before accepting a match, click the **Conflict Check** button (warning triangle):
- Checks for existing assertions that contradict the proposed relationship
- For example, a `differentFrom` assertion would conflict with a `sameAs` proposal
- Shows "Safe to accept" if no conflicts found

### sameAs Assertion Creation

When a `sameAs` match is accepted:
1. An assertion is automatically created: Entity A `sameAs` Entity B
2. The assertion includes the resolution evidence
3. The assertion appears in the knowledge graph

### Entity Link Network

Use `getEntityLinks()` to see all accepted resolutions for an entity — its full sameAs/relatedTo network.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot access research portal | Ensure you are logged in and registered as a researcher |
| Registration pending | Wait for admin approval; contact your archivist |
| Booking rejected | Check your researcher type limits (days advance, hours per day) |
| Materials not available | Check retrieval queue status; materials may be in use |
| Annotations not saving | Clear browser cache; check for JavaScript errors |
| Export fails | Check file permissions on the uploads directory |
| API key not working | Verify key is active and not expired |
| ORCID connection fails | Check ORCID configuration in app.yml |
| Snapshot hash mismatch | Data may have been modified; contact admin |
| Search diff shows no changes | Ensure you have taken at least one snapshot first |

### Browser Compatibility
